.. _extra_index_url:

Add additional index URL to search
==================================

Pip accepts URLs for additional package indexes through ``--extra-index-url``.
The same option can be passed to ``pip-compile-multi`` during compilation.

This option is similar to `annotate_index`_.
The difference is that the passed URL is not saved in any of the files,
which is helpful if the URL contains private credentials.

.. code-block:: text

    --extra-index-url TEXT          Add additional package index URL to search
                                    for package versions. Can be supplied
                                    multiple times.


.. warning::

    Using ``--extra-index-url`` option to search for packages that are not in
    the main repository (such as private packages) is unsafe, per a security vulnerability
    called `dependency confusion`_: an attacker can claim the package on
    the public repository in a way that will ensure it gets chosen over the private package.

    Use the ``--index-url`` option in pipâ€™s configuration file or command line
    to specify the feed, overriding the default.
    Avoid the ``--extra-index-url`` option, which is additive and may lead
    to having multiple indexes.

    See `pip documentation`_ for details.
