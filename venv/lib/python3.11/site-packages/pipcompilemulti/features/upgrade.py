Disable upgrades
================

When new dependencies are added it's tempting to keep everything else the same.
To recompile ``.txt`` keeping satisfying version use ``--no-upgrade``:

.. code-block:: text

    --upgrade / --no-upgrade    Upgrade package version (default true)

The option has no effect if there are no existing ``.txt`` files.

Upgrade only selected packages
==============================

To upgrade only one package and keep everything else untouched,
use following option:

.. code-block:: text

    -P, --upgrade-package TEXT  Only upgrade named package.
                                Can be supplied multiple times.

Under the hood it uses `the same option of pip-compile`_
and runs compilation only for files that have one of the passed packages.

This option implies ``--no-upgrade`` and takes precedence over ``--upgrade``.
